# Number Guessing Game Task Requirements

## Objective
Create a Python program for a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

## Requirements
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Prompt the user to input their guess
- Provide feedback after each guess:
  - "Too high" if the guess exceeds the number
  - "Too low" if the guess is below the number
- Limit the user to a maximum of 10 attempts
- Track the number of attempts taken
- Include input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number
- Display an appropriate message at the end:
  - If the user wins: congratulate them and show the number of attempts
  - If the user loses: inform them the game is over and reveal the number
- Use a loop to allow multiple guesses until the number is guessed or attempts run out
